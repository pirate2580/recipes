    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>" This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce 
      as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake 
      until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes
      well, too." <a href = "https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/lasagna/">- source</a>

    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
      <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles - requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken</li>
      <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) 
        on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to
        a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while 
        the water is heating.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the 
        ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides. Remove the beef with 
        a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</li>
      <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed 
        tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot. Add the parsley, oregano, and 
        Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or
        garlic salt, to taste. Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon
        at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste. Add salt to taste, and note that you will 
        later be adding Parmesan, which is salty. Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat
        to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the
        pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches. Remove from heat.
